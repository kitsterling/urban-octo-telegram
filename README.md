# Horiseon's Webpage, refactored by Kit Banker

Horiseon is a webpage for connecting with Horiseon, a company designed to make your organization succeed.

# Description of refactoring

In this project, I completed the following:

- Refactored divs to more semantic HTML elements such as header, footer, nav, article, section, and aside.
- Added alt text where deemed necessary for images missing the alt text.
- Reorganized and commented on the CSS file to make everything in it more readable.
- Fixed a link in the navigation bar that wasn't working.
- Changed the title of the webpage to "Horiseon ðŸ“±".
